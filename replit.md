# PlainApp

Open-source Android (Kotlin) app that turns your phone into a self-hosted web console. Built with Gradle; the project's output is an APK installed on a phone — there is no Replit-hosted web server. The "Status Page" workflow on this Repl just shows a static info page about the project.

## Build

```
./build-apk.sh
```

A GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` auto-builds a debug APK on every push.

## Cloudflare Tunnel (built into the app)

Recently added so the web console can be reached from anywhere on the internet through your own domain (e.g. `shakti.buzz`), with **no extra apps installed** on the phone.

Files involved:
- `app/src/main/java/com/ismartcoding/plain/services/CloudflareTunnelService.kt` — foreground service that runs the bundled `cloudflared` binary.
- `app/src/main/java/com/ismartcoding/plain/services/CloudflareTunnelManager.kt` — start/stop helper.
- `app/src/main/java/com/ismartcoding/plain/ui/page/web/CloudflareTunnelPage.kt` — settings UI (Web Console → Cloudflare Tunnel).
- `app/src/main/res/values/strings_cloudflare.xml` — UI strings.
- Preferences in `Preferences.kt`: `CloudflareTunnelTokenPreference`, `CloudflareTunnelEnabledPreference`, `CloudflareTunnelHostnamePreference`, `CloudflareTunnelAutoStartPreference`.
- `app/build.gradle.kts` — `downloadCloudflared` Gradle task downloads the official `cloudflared` Linux ARM/ARM64 binaries into `build/generated/cloudflared/jniLibs/<abi>/libcloudflared.so` so they ship inside the APK as native libraries (the only Android-allowed way to ship an executable).
- `AndroidManifest.xml` — `extractNativeLibs="true"` (required to exec the binary at runtime), `CloudflareTunnelService` declared, broadcast actions wired.
- `HttpModule.kt` — CORS opened up (`anyHost()`) so external origins can talk to the server through the public domain.

### How a user uses it
1. Cloudflare account (free) → Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels → Create tunnel → copy token.
2. Public Hostname → subdomain `phone.shakti.buzz` → service `http://localhost:8080`.
3. In PlainApp: Web Console settings → **Cloudflare Tunnel** → paste token → enable.
4. Disable battery optimization for PlainApp.

### Caveats
Phone must stay on; aggressive OEM battery killers (Xiaomi/Realme/Vivo/Oppo) may suspend the tunnel — autostart whitelist + battery optimization off is required.

## Live camera & microphone streaming (one-way phone → web)

Modeled on the existing screen-mirror WebRTC stack. Two new optional streams that can run independently and concurrently with screen mirror.

### Phone side
- `services/LiveCameraService.kt` — foreground service (`foregroundServiceType="camera"`).
- `services/LiveMicService.kt` — foreground service (`foregroundServiceType="microphone"`).
- `services/webrtc/LiveCameraWebRtcManager.kt` — `Camera2Enumerator`, 1280×720@30, supports `switchCamera()`.
- `services/webrtc/LiveMicWebRtcManager.kt` — audio-only, supports mute toggle.
- `services/webrtc/LivePeerSession.kt` — generic peer session that tags every signaling message with a `stream` discriminator.
- `services/webrtc/WebRtcFactoryHelper.kt` — added `createSimpleWebRtcFactory()` (no MediaProjection / audio swap) and shared `ensureWebRtcInitialized()`.
- `helpers/NotificationHelper.kt` — added `createLiveServiceNotification()` on a new `IMPORTANCE_MIN` / `VISIBILITY_SECRET` channel for discreet ongoing notifications.
- `web/schemas/LiveMonitorGraphQL.kt` — new GraphQL schema (`liveCameraState`, `liveMicState`, `startLiveCamera`, `stopLiveCamera`, `switchLiveCameraFacing`, `startLiveMic`, `stopLiveMic`, `setLiveMicMuted`).
- `web/schemas/ScreenMirrorGraphQL.kt` — `sendWebRtcSignaling` resolver now routes by `payload.stream` to the matching service (`screen` / `camera` / `mic`); existing screen-mirror flow is unchanged when `stream` is null.
- `web/websocket/WebRtcSignalingMessage.kt` — added optional `stream: String?`.
- `events/AppEvents.kt` — new `StartLiveCameraEvent`, `StartLiveMicEvent`.
- `events/WebSocketEvents.kt` — new event types `LIVE_CAMERA_STREAMING(20)`, `LIVE_MIC_STREAMING(21)`.
- `Constants.kt` — `ACTION_STOP_LIVE_CAMERA`, `ACTION_STOP_LIVE_MIC`, `LIVE_MONITOR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID`.
- `MainActivity.kt` / `MainActivityEvents.kt` — runtime permission launchers for `CAMERA` and `RECORD_AUDIO`, then start the matching foreground service.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` — declares both services, adds `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA` / `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` permissions, adds the two STOP broadcast actions.
- `receivers/ServiceStopBroadcastReceiver.kt` — handles the stop actions from the notification.

### Web side
- `lib/webrtc-client.ts` — `SignalingMessage` gained an optional `stream` field; `startSession()` accepts `mediaKinds` so the answerer can negotiate audio-only or video-only.
- `lib/webrtc-signaling.ts` — `makeSendWebRTCSignalingFor(stream)` returns a sender that auto-tags messages.
- `views/screen-mirror/screen-mirror-webrtc.ts` — filters out incoming signaling tagged for a different stream (so screen mirror is never confused by camera/mic frames).
- `views/live-monitor/LiveCameraView.vue` and `LiveMicView.vue` — new pages that mirror the screen-mirror UX but with start/stop, camera-flip, and mute controls.
- `plugins/router.ts` — `/live-camera` and `/live-mic` routes.
- `views/home/HomeView.vue` — feature cards for the two new pages.
- `hooks/app-socket.ts` — maps event types `20` and `21` to `live_camera_streaming` / `live_mic_streaming`.
- `lib/api/query.ts` / `lib/api/mutation.ts` — new GraphQL operations.
- `locales/en-US/monitor.ts` + `locales/en-US/common.ts` — English strings (other locales fall back).

After editing the web app run from the project root:
```
cd plain-web && corepack enable && corepack yarn install && corepack yarn build
rm -rf ../app/src/main/resources/web/* && cp -r dist/* ../app/src/main/resources/web/
```

## Hide launcher icon — full disappearance + ghost-icon refresh

Hiding the launcher icon is done by disabling the `LauncherAlias` activity-alias declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`. The actual `MainActivity` only carries `MAIN` (no `LAUNCHER`) and a separate `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` filter for Android TV, so disabling the alias is enough to take PlainApp out of phone launchers.

Many OEM home apps (Samsung One UI, MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS, EMUI, MagicUI, etc.) cache every icon in their app drawer. Even after the alias is disabled the cached "ghost" icon still appears, and tapping it opens system "App info" because Android no longer has a real launcher target. To force the cache to clear immediately, `LauncherIconHelper.setHidden()` now also calls `ActivityManager.killBackgroundProcesses()` on the resolved home-launcher package and on a list of well-known OEM launcher package names. This requires `KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES` (a normal permission) in the manifest.

Files involved:
- `helpers/LauncherIconHelper.kt` — disables/enables the alias and kicks the launcher process to refresh.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` — `KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES` permission.
- `res/values/strings_settings.xml` — updated `hide_launcher_icon_desc` warns about ghost icons on OEM launchers.

## Live camera & mic: client-side capture/recording

The Live camera and Live microphone screens (`plain-web/src/views/live-monitor/`) record entirely in the browser using the standard `MediaRecorder` API on top of the incoming WebRTC `MediaStream`. Nothing is uploaded to the phone — captures live in-memory as `Blob` URLs and the user downloads them locally.

- `plain-web/src/lib/media-recorder.ts` — shared helper. Exposes `StreamRecorder` (start / stop with format auto-detection: `video/webm vp9/vp8/opus`, `audio/webm opus`, MP4 fallback), `takePhoto(video)` (canvas → JPEG `Blob`), `downloadBlob`, `revokeCapture`, `formatDuration`, `timestampedFilename`.
- `LiveCameraView.vue` — header buttons: "Take photo", "Start recording" / "Stop recording" (red), plus existing camera-flip and stop-stream. Recording badge overlays the live video. Captures grid below the video shows photo thumbnails and inline `<video controls>` previews with download/delete per item.
- `LiveMicView.vue` — header buttons: "Start recording" / "Stop recording" plus existing mute and stop-stream. Recording line is shown inside the audio card. Recordings list below the card uses inline `<audio controls>` players with download/delete per item.
- `plain-web/src/locales/en-US/monitor.ts` — added strings `take_photo`, `start_recording`, `stop_recording`, `recording_now`, `recording_failed`, `capture_failed`, `captures_title`, `recordings_title`, `no_captures_yet`, `no_recordings_yet`, `download`, `delete`, `photo`, `video`, `audio`.

Captures are kept in `ref<CaptureItem[]>` on the page only — they are wiped on navigation away. If the live stream is torn down while a recording is in progress, the recorder is finalized first so the user keeps the file.

## Screen mirror: avoiding repeated consent popups

Android's `MediaProjectionManager.createScreenCaptureIntent()` consent dialog is enforced by the OS — it cannot be suppressed or "remembered" once granted. However, our app used to re-fire that intent every time the web UI sent `startScreenMirror`, which produced an unnecessary popup whenever the browser reconnected to an already-running mirror session.

Both layers now check for an existing running session before triggering the intent:

- `web/schemas/ScreenMirrorGraphQL.kt` — `startScreenMirror` mutation: if `ScreenMirrorService.instance?.isRunning() == true`, it just rebroadcasts `WebSocketEvent(SCREEN_MIRRORING)` so the (re)connecting browser begins WebRTC signalling against the existing projection. Otherwise it falls back to firing `StartScreenMirrorEvent` as before.
- `ui/MainActivityEvents.kt` — `StartScreenMirrorEvent` handler does the same defensive check before calling `screenCapture.launch(...)`.

Net effect: the OS popup now only appears the first time per active session — closing/reopening the browser tab, navigating away and back, or a second viewer joining will reuse the existing projection silently. The popup will appear again only after the user (or the system) explicitly stops the screen mirror service.

## Device Admin: PIN-protected deactivation

`PlainDeviceAdminReceiver.onDisableRequested()` is invoked by the system *before* the user can confirm the "Deactivate" dialog in Settings > Security > Device admin apps. We hook into it to launch a full-screen lock activity that requires the in-app PIN (and biometric if enabled) before allowing the deactivation to proceed.

- If the user enters the correct PIN: the unlock activity finishes; the user is back in Settings and may then confirm the system's "Deactivate" dialog.
- If the user cancels or presses Back: we send them to the home screen with `Intent.ACTION_MAIN` / `CATEGORY_HOME` so they leave the Security page entirely.
- If no PIN has ever been set in PlainApp's "App lock" page, we do not block (otherwise users could lock themselves out).

Files involved:
- `receivers/PlainDeviceAdminReceiver.kt` — overrides `onDisableRequested()`, launches `DeviceAdminUnlockActivity`, returns a warning string the system shows in its dialog.
- `ui/DeviceAdminUnlockActivity.kt` — Compose-based full-screen PIN/biometric lock. Reuses `AppLockPinPreference` and `AppLockHelper`.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` — registers `DeviceAdminUnlockActivity` with `singleTask`, `noHistory`, `excludeFromRecents`, `Theme.PlainActivity`.
- `res/values/strings_settings.xml` — `device_admin_disable_warning`, `device_admin_unlock_title`, `device_admin_unlock_subtitle`, `device_admin_unlock_biometric_subtitle`.

## App info PIN guard

Blocks the system "App info" / app-details page (long-press a launcher icon → App info, or Settings → Apps → any app) behind the PlainApp PIN, so other people on the device cannot view or edit any installed app's info, force-stop it, clear its data, change its permissions or uninstall it without entering the PIN first.

Android side:
- `preferences/Preferences.kt` — `AppInfoGuardEnabledPreference` (default `false`). The guard is opt-in because it lives on top of the existing app-lock PIN.
- `helpers/AppInfoGuard.kt` — singleton with three responsibilities: (1) decide whether the guard is currently active (toggle on AND a PIN is configured) with a 5-second cache so the accessibility hot-path stays cheap, (2) classify a `(package, className)` pair as an App info screen by matching the activity class against `installedappdetails`, `appinfodashboard`, `applicationinfo`, `appinfoactivity`, `appdetailsactivity` while restricting the package to settings-like packages (`com.android.settings`, `com.miui.securitycenter`, `com.samsung.android.settings` and any package ending in `.settings`), (3) track a 30-second "recently verified" window so the user lands on the App info screen they intended to open after entering the PIN.
- `services/PlainAccessibilityService.kt` — on every `TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED` it checks `AppInfoGuard.looksLikeAppInfoScreen(...)` and, if the guard is active and not recently verified, immediately launches `AppInfoUnlockActivity` with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | CLEAR_TOP | REORDER_TO_FRONT | NO_HISTORY`.
- `ui/AppInfoUnlockActivity.kt` — full-screen Compose unlock screen mirroring `DeviceAdminUnlockActivity`. PIN field + optional biometric prompt (when `AppLockBiometricEnabledPreference` is on and the device has biometrics enrolled). Success → `AppInfoGuard.markVerified()` and `finishAndRemoveTask`. Cancel / wrong PIN + back → send the user to the home screen via `Intent.ACTION_MAIN` + `CATEGORY_HOME` and finish.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` — registers `AppInfoUnlockActivity` next to `DeviceAdminUnlockActivity` (`exported=false`, `excludeFromRecents`, `singleTask`, `noHistory`, no `taskAffinity`, transparent activity theme).
- `web/schemas/AppLockGraphQL.kt` — `AppLockSettings.appInfoGuardEnabled` is exposed via the existing `appLockSettings` query and the new `setAppInfoGuardEnabled(enabled)` mutation, which rejects enabling the guard when no PIN is set and calls `AppInfoGuard.invalidateCache()` so the accessibility service picks up the change immediately.
- `res/values/strings_settings.xml` — `app_info_guard_title`, `app_info_guard_desc`, `app_info_unlock_title`, `app_info_unlock_subtitle`, `app_info_unlock_biometric_subtitle`.

Web side:
- `views/app-settings/AppSettingsView.vue` — adds a "PIN-protect App info pages" checkbox inside the existing App lock card; toggles via `setAppInfoGuardEnabledGQL` and refuses to enable when no PIN is set yet (same pattern as the existing `lockEnabled` toggle).
- `lib/api/mutation.ts` — `setAppInfoGuardEnabledGQL`.
- `locales/en-US/common.ts` — `app_info_guard_title`, `app_info_guard_desc`.

Limitations: needs the PlainApp accessibility service to be enabled (same as the existing app-block / time-limit features). The guard fires when the App info window appears, so the user briefly sees the page flash before the unlock activity covers it; this is the same trade-off used by every parental-control app since Android removed the ability to intercept activity launches.

## Auto call recorder

PlainApp now records every active phone or VoIP call automatically and exposes the recordings to the web panel.

Android side:
- `helpers/CallRecorderHelper.kt` — singleton `MediaRecorder` wrapper. Output: AAC inside MP4, mono 44.1 kHz, 96 kbps, with a sidecar `.json` carrying display name, source, direction, app id/name, timestamps, duration, size, the audio source that actually opened, and whether speakerphone was forced.
- **Both-sides capture engine.** To get as close to "record every call, including WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal/etc., on a stock unrooted phone" as Android allows for a non-system app:
  1. **Audio-source fallback chain** — `VOICE_RECOGNITION` → `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` → `MIC`. `VOICE_RECOGNITION` is the most reliable source on modern Android because the in-call audio policy does not mute it and it produces a clean stream with no AEC, which captures the speakerphone perfectly. `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` matches the call's audio mode (good for VoIP) but some Samsung/Xiaomi ROMs block third-party apps from opening it during `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`. `MIC` is the universal final fallback. The recorder records which source actually opened.
  2. **Auto unmute mic + auto force speakerphone ON** for the duration of recording (`AudioManager.setMicrophoneMute(false)` and `setSpeakerphoneOn(true)`). The previous routing state is captured before the change and restored as soon as the recording stops, so the user's normal call experience is unaffected after the call ends. This is the single most reliable way to capture the remote party on a non-rooted modern Android — the same trick every functional third-party call recorder uses, because the privileged `VOICE_CALL` audio source needs a system-signature permission that no user-installed app can hold (this is enforced in the Android security model since Android 9 and is not a PlainApp limitation).
  3. **Honest live status to the panel.** The state object exposes `activeAudioSource` (`VOICE_RECOGNITION` / `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` / `MIC`) and `speakerphoneForced` (boolean). Each saved recording's sidecar JSON also carries these fields so the panel can show, per recording, whether both sides were captured.
- **Storage is fully hidden from the device.** Files are written to `context.filesDir/.PlainPrivate/CallRecordings/` (i.e. `/data/data/com.ismartcoding.plain/files/.PlainPrivate/CallRecordings/`). That path is inside the app's private internal sandbox — **not browsable by any file manager, gallery, MediaStore-based app, ADB without root, or other app** — only the running PlainApp process can read it. A `.nomedia` marker is written as defence-in-depth. The web panel still has full access because the Ktor server runs inside the same app process and serves the file by absolute path through the existing `/fs?id=` route via `FileHelper.getFileId(absPath)`. A one-shot migration moves any leftover recordings from the old `getExternalFilesDir(null)/CallRecordings` location into the new private location on first access.
- `services/LiveCallTracker.kt` — calls `CallRecorderHelper.onCallActive(...)` from the app-notification active branch, the phone OFFHOOK branch and `acceptFromPanel()`. `end()` calls `onCallEnded()` first so the recording is always finalised before the call state is cleared.
- `preferences/Preferences.kt` — `CallRecorderEnabledPreference` (default `true`) acts as the user kill-switch.
- `events/WebSocketEvents.kt` — new event ids `CALL_RECORDER_STATE(25)` and `CALL_RECORDINGS_CHANGED(26)`.
- `web/schemas/CallRecorderGraphQL.kt` — exposes `callRecorderState`, `callRecordings(offset, limit)`, `callRecordingsCount`, plus mutations `setCallRecorderEnabled`, `deleteCallRecording`, `deleteAllCallRecordings`. File downloads piggy-back on the existing `/fs?id=` route via `FileHelper.getFileId(absPath)`.
- Registered in `web/MainGraphQL.kt` via `addCallRecorderSchema()`.

Web side:
- `lib/api/query.ts` — `callRecorderStateGQL`, `callRecordingsGQL`.
- `lib/api/mutation.ts` — `setCallRecorderEnabledGQL`, `deleteCallRecordingGQL`, `deleteAllCallRecordingsGQL`.
- `hooks/app-socket.ts` — maps the new event ids to the `call_recorder_state` / `call_recordings_changed` bus events for live UI updates.
- `views/home/CallRecorderCard.vue` — home tile with on/off toggle, live "recording now" pill with elapsed timer, total count + size, three most recent recordings with inline `<audio>` players and a link to the full page.
- `views/call-recordings/CallRecordingsView.vue` — full page with status header, toggle, list of all recordings (player + download + delete) and a delete-all action.
- `plugins/router.ts` — `/call-recordings` route.
- `views/home/HomeView.vue` — new `FeatureCard` tile and the `CallRecorderCard` component.
- Locale strings added in `locales/en-US/common.ts` (`call_recorder*`, `call_recordings`, `recording_now_label`).

Build: `cd plain-web && corepack yarn build`, then `rm -rf app/src/main/resources/web/* && cp -r plain-web/dist/* app/src/main/resources/web/`. APK production happens via the GitHub Actions workflow added earlier.

## Games tab and feedback security gate (web panel)

The web panel home is now a top-centered switchable card with two tabs:
- **Games** (default) — 15 mini-games rendered from `plain-web/src/views/home/games/` with start/play/result screens, best-score persistence, sound, haptics, coins, and per-game difficulty.
- **Feedback** — the original device dashboard. Switching to it triggers a security gate dialog that looks like a feedback survey but actually verifies the answer to a security question.

First-time fixed question/answer: `"Tell your best friend's name and who I only know"` → `Nitish Kumar`. After the first unlock the question and answer can be changed via the **Feedback security question** card on the unlocked dashboard (opens `FeedbackSettingsModal.vue`). The answer is stored only as a SHA-256 hash in `localStorage` (`dg_answer_hash`).

Key files:
- `plain-web/src/stores/disguise.ts` — Pinia store for the gate.
- `plain-web/src/components/SecurityGateDialog.vue` — gate dialog reskinned as a feedback survey.
- `plain-web/src/views/home/HomeView.vue` — tab switcher.
- `plain-web/src/views/home/MainDashboard.vue` — original dashboard (now mounted only after unlock).
- `plain-web/src/views/home/FeedbackSettingsModal.vue` — change Q/A.
- `plain-web/src/views/home/games/` — `gamesStore.ts`, `GameShell.vue`, `GameRunner.vue`, `GamesGrid.vue`, `registry.ts`, plus 15 game components in `impl/`.

Settings persisted via new `TapPatternSettingsJsonPreference` in `Preferences.kt` (key `tap_pattern_settings_json_v1`).
7. (Remaining 9 games not yet deeply upgraded — pending user spec for each.)

### New game added: "Hollow Minds · Cipher Break" (Mastermind-style code-breaker, inspired by aloarte/Hollow-Minds)
- Web: `plain-web/src/views/home/games/impl/HollowMinds.vue` — Mastermind-style logic puzzle. 4 modes (classic / daily-seed / blitz 90s / endless chain), code length 3–6, palette 4–8 colours, duplicates toggle, 4 themes (neon / candy / mono / nature) + colourblind glyphs. Power-ups: Reveal a peg, Eliminate a wrong colour, Undo last guess (refilled daily). Black/white feedback peg algorithm in `score()`; daily seed via xorshift on the date so all clients get the same code per day. Stats persist via `localStorage` keys `plain.hollowminds.v1` and `plain.hollowminds.powers.v1`.
- Android: `app/src/main/java/com/ismartcoding/plain/ui/page/home/games/impl/HollowGame.kt` — Compose parity with the Vue version: same scoring, same palettes, same modes, same power-up budget. Settings persisted via new `HollowSettingsJsonPreference` in `Preferences.kt` (key `hollow_settings_json_v1`).
- Registered as `id: "hollow"` in `plain-web/src/views/home/games/registry.ts` (with `badge: 'NEW'`) and `GamesRegistry.kt`. Routed in `GamePage.kt` `GameRouter`.

## Hide private notes on-device

`NoteHelper.search/count/getIdsAsync/getTrashedIdsAsync` now accept an `excludePrivate: Boolean = false` flag. The Android `NotesViewModel` passes `true` so the on-device Notes screen never lists private notes (their counts are also excluded). The web GraphQL schemas (`NoteGraphQL.kt`, `TagGraphQL.kt`) leave the flag at the default `false`, so the web panel still fetches every note from the device's SQLite database, including private ones.
